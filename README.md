**Introduction**

This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using SQL to gain meaningful business insights. The dataset includes order details, pizza types, sizes, categories, pricing, and order timestamps. By querying and joining multiple tables, the project aims to understand customer preferences, sales trends, and revenue performance. The analysis helps demonstrate how SQL can be effectively used to explore transactional data and support business decision-making.

**Problem**

A pizza store generates a large volume of sales data daily, but without proper analysis, it is difficult to understand:

- Overall sales and revenue performance
- Customer preferences for pizza types and sizes
- Peak ordering hours and daily demand
- Best- and worst-performing pizza categories
- Revenue contribution of individual pizzas over time
  
The business needs a structured way to analyze this data to improve operations, pricing, and product strategy.

**Solution**

Using SQL, the project answers key business questions by:

- Calculating total orders and total revenue generated
- Identifying the highest-priced pizza and most commonly ordered pizza size
- Finding top-selling pizza types and categories based on quantity and revenue
- Analyzing order distribution by hour of the day
- Calculating average daily pizza demand
- Using window functions to rank top revenue-generating pizzas within each category
- Tracking cumulative revenue over time to understand sales growth patterns

These queries transform raw sales data into actionable insights using joins, aggregations, subqueries, and window functions.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze real-world sales data and extract valuable business insights. By identifying top-performing products, customer preferences, and sales trends, the analysis supports data-driven decision-making for improving revenue, pricing strategies, and inventory planning. Overall, the project highlights strong SQL fundamentals and showcases the practical application of data analysis techniques in a retail business context.

**Key insights**

The analysis shows that the pizza store has processed over 21,000 orders, generating approximately $820,000 in total revenue, indicating strong overall demand. Large-sized pizzas account for nearly 50% of total orders, making them the most preferred size and suggesting that inventory and promotions should prioritize this segment. A small group of top-performing pizza types contributes more than 30% of total sales volume, while the top three pizzas in each category generate close to 40% of category-level revenue, highlighting the need to focus marketing and pricing strategies on these high-revenue items. Order volumes peak between 12 PM and 8 PM, so staffing and operational resources should be optimized during lunch and dinner hours to reduce wait times and improve service efficiency. On average, 130–150 pizzas are sold per day, which can be used to plan daily inventory and reduce waste. Additionally, the presence of premium pizzas priced up to $35 suggests an opportunity to further promote high-margin products. Overall, the business should focus on promoting best-selling pizzas, optimizing peak-hour operations, and leveraging premium offerings to maximize revenue and profitability.
